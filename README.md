# PRODIGY_DS_01
# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 1
Tools Utilized:

--> Python


--> Jupyter Notebook


--> Matplotlib Library,

# Overview Of Task


To create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.


# What we're trying to do:


We'll use Python and a tool called Matplotlib to look at how many people there are of different ages and genders in the world.



# Understanding the gender spread:


We'll make a picture (histogram) to see how many males and females there are.
By looking at how many people fall into each category (male/female), we can learn interesting things about how genders are spread out across the population.



# Wrapping it up:


This project uses Python and Matplotlib to create pictures (visualizations) that help us understand how many people there are of different ages and genders in the world.
By looking at these pictures and doing more analysis, we can learn even more about the different groups of people that make up the world's population.
